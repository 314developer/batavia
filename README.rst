Batavia
=======

Tools to run Python bytecode in the browser.

This is experimental code. If it breaks, you get to keep all the shiny pieces.

What it does:

* Unmarshals Base64 encoded bytecode into Code objects

* Implements most of the common Python VM opcodes

What it doesn't do:

* Make a good distinction between integer and floating point math

* Any attempt at unicode handling.
